# TO DO App React Redux

## Can someone suggest me a better color theme

I need help here.  
`src/components/todo.css`  

I want the bg to change for `.todo` and `.DONE`

Also kindly write the message  

Also in you PR message/comment write  
`issue #3 solved.`  

You might add a few more lines if you wish.  
As good practise.  

## SETUP

It is a `node.js` project

so clone   <https://github.com/OAtulA/React-REDUX-TO-DO-App> 

using 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OAtulA/React-REDUX-TO-DO-App
```

Next  
```sh
cd React-REDUX-TO-DO-App
```

```sh
