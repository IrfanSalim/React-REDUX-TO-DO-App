# TO DO App React Redux

## Can someone suggest me a better color theme

I need help here.  
`src/components/todo.css`  

I want the bg to change for `.todo` and `.DONE`

Also kindly write the message  

Also in you PR message/comment write  
`issue #3 solved.`  

You might add a few more lines if you wish.  
As good practise.
